### Autonomous Quadrotor Design and Control

This repository contains our work and progress towards building a quadrotor with real-time embedded control. The final goal is to have it autonomously fly and hold a position in space.

#### Milestones
- [x] Inertial measurement unit (IMU) connected to PI and calibrated. 
- [x] Complementary filter implemented (high pass filter on gyroscope, low pass filter on accelerometer) for more accurate and stable pitch/roll calculations
- [x] Quadrotor assembled (motors + PWM board, battery, IMU, PI, PWM) 
- [x] Proportional controller for pitch
- [x] Accelerometer filter analysis on angle noise
